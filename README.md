# Syllabus-Java022815
The detailed syllabus for the Java bootcamp launching Feb. 28th, 2015
		
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Overview: 

Class description: According to the STLCC Workforce development group, the most sought-after specific skills among St. Louis tech jobs in 2014 were SQL, Oracle resources, and Java programming. Developers in the Java environment are the backbone of large corporations in St. Louis, and demand has never been higher for entry-level programmers.

Skills learned: Our 12-week course in Java will cover the basics of developing in industry-standard environments.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Schedule: 

**Daily schedule**: All daily assignments are to be completed before class starts. Classes will begin with a quick Q&A over the previous daily assignment and current weekly project. Claim can be used as a workspace any time between 8am and 6pm Monday-Friday for those looking to work on projects or assignements beforehand.

**Weekly schedule**: classes will be held every Monday through Friday evening from 6pm-9pm, and every Saturday from 8am-5pm, unless otherwise changed by an instructor beforehand. Saturdays will focus on a weekly project workshop, with a more free-form, lab environment until projects are completed.

**Holidays and days off**: The aforementioned schedule will continue uninterrupted until May 23rd, with the exception of Easter weekend (Good Friday, Saturday, and Easter Sunday). Because of Easter, we will not have class on April 5th, 4th, and 3rd.
